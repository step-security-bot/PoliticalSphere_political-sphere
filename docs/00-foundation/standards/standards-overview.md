## 📊 Usage Guidelines

### 🔍 How to Use This Framework

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate work against the quality levels
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas for improvement
3. **Action Planning**: Develop specific improvement actions
4. **Tracking**: Monitor progress toward higher quality levels
5. **Review**: Regular reassessment to ensure standards are met

### 📈 Quality Improvement Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current Assessment] --> B[Identify Gaps]
    B --> C[Prioritize Improvements]
    C --> D[Implement Changes]
    D --> E[Reassess Quality]
    E --> F{Meets Target?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Maintain Standards]
    F -->|No| B
```

### 🎯 Target Quality Levels

- **Minimum Acceptable**: Level 2 for all production work
- **Target Standard**: Level 3 for core systems and processes
- **Excellence Goal**: Level 4 for critical components
- **Benchmark**: Level 5 for reference implementations
