## 🌟 Core Product Principles

### 1. Fair, Balanced, Rule-Driven Simulation

**The game must feel consistent, structured, and credible. Systems reflect procedural political mechanics. Rules are transparent and applied equally. No pay-to-win, no hidden influence systems.**

### 2. Player Agency With Structured Consequences

**Players control their choices and strategy, and the world responds. Every action has an in-world effect. Reputation, relationships, and outcomes matter. Strategic play beats randomness or spam.**

### 3. Integrity of the Game World

**The simulation must remain internally coherent and fictionally self-contained. No bleed into real-world politics or persuasion. No agenda-driven content. In-world systems only, for in-world consequences.**

### 4. Safety, Respect & Well-Governed Community

**Political themes require strong guardrails. Zero tolerance for harassment, threats, hate, or mobilisation. Clear behavioural expectations. Human-in-the-loop moderation augmented by AI.**

### 5. Meaningful Complexity, Not Overwhelm

**Depth is a feature. Chaos is not. Complex systems, but understandable. Proper onboarding and progressive learning. Clarity beats noise.**

### 6. Long-Term Strategic Engagement

**Design for sustained participation. Persistent world and evolving meta. Parties, factions, alliances, and rivalries have history. Systems encourage return play and continuity.**

### 7. Transparency & Explainability

**Players must understand what's happening and why. Clear mechanics and feedback loops. Auditable actions for moderation and governance. AI behaviour explainable and constrained.**

### 8. Ethical AI & Systems Design

**AI supports the game—never manipulates reality. No real-world persuasion. Safety filters, audit logs, escalation policies. Systemic fairness over emotional manipulation.**
