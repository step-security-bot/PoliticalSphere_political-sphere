## 🗂️ Archival Process

### Archival Triggers

Documents are moved to archival storage when:

- **Age-based**: Document reaches end of active retention period
- **Usage-based**: Document hasn't been accessed for 2+ years
- **Project completion**: Project ends and documentation is no longer actively used
- **System migration**: Documents from retired systems require preservation

### Archival Procedures

---

## 📋 Disposal Process

### Disposal Triggers

Documents are disposed when:

- **Retention period expires**: Standard disposal after retention requirements met
- **Legal hold released**: Documents under legal hold are disposed after hold expiration
- **Classification change**: Documents down-classified may have reduced retention
- **Business decision**: Obsolete documents approved for early disposal

### Disposal Methods

| Classification   | Method                                       | Verification             | Documentation            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Public**       | Standard deletion                            | File system confirmation | Disposal log entry       |
| **Internal**     | Secure deletion (DoD 5220.22-M)              | Overwrite verification   | Disposal certificate     |
| **Confidential** | Cryptographic erasure + physical destruction | Multi-pass verification  | Chain of custody log     |
| **Restricted**   | Physical shredding + cryptographic erasure   | Witnessed destruction    | Legal disposal affidavit |

### Disposal Procedures

```mermaid

    A[Document Reaches Disposal Date] --> B[Review Legal Holds]
    B --> C{Hold in Place?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Extend Retention Period]
    C -->|No| E[Select Disposal Method]
    E --> F[Execute Disposal]
    F --> G[Verify Destruction]
    G --> H[Document Disposal Event]
    H --> I[Update Records]
    I --> J[Notify Compliance Team]
```

### Disposal Verification

**Technical Verification:**

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I know when a document should be archived?

**A:** Documents are automatically flagged for archival based on their retention schedule. You'll receive notifications 90 days before archival. For manual archival requests, consult the Records Management team.

### Q: Can retention periods be extended?

**A:** Yes, with proper justification and approval. Legal requirements take precedence, but business needs can extend retention for operational documents. Submit extension requests through the Compliance Team.

### Q: What happens if I need to access an archived document?

**A:** Submit a retrieval request through the Records Management portal. Most documents are available within 24 hours. Critical documents may require additional approval.

### Q: How are documents securely disposed?

**A:** Disposal methods vary by classification. Public documents are deleted, confidential documents are cryptographically erased, and restricted documents are physically shredded. All disposal is verified and documented.

### Q: What if a document is under legal hold?

**A:** Legal holds supersede normal retention schedules. You'll be notified if any of your documents are placed on hold, and they cannot be disposed until the hold is released.

### Q: How does this policy apply to email?

**A:** Email is treated as documents and subject to the same retention rules. Business email is retained for 7 years, operational email for 3 years. Personal email is not retained unless it contains business records.

5. **Stakeholder Approval** - Legal, compliance, and business approval

**Change Triggers:**

- New regulatory requirements
- Significant business changes
- Technology platform updates
- Legal precedents or court rulings
- Audit findings or recommendations

### Schedule Implementation

**Automated Enforcement:**

```bash
# Check retention compliance
npm run retention:audit -- --period=2025-Q4

# Identify documents ready for disposal
npm run retention:identify -- --action=dispose --older-than=7years

# Apply legal hold
npm run legal-hold -- --case-id=LEGAL-2025-001 --scope="contracts/*"
```

**Manual Oversight:**

- Quarterly compliance reports
- Exception approval workflow
- Annual certification by legal counsel

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Archive System Architecture

**Storage Tiers:**

```
Active Documents → Archive Tier 1 (SSD) → Archive Tier 2 (Tape) → Archive Tier 3 (Optical WORM)
     ↓                ↓                        ↓                        ↓
  30 days          7 years                 20 years               Permanent
```

**Access Patterns:**

- **Hot Access:** Frequently accessed archives (immediate retrieval)
- **Warm Access:** Occasionally accessed (hours to retrieve)
- **Cold Access:** Rarely accessed (days to retrieve)
- **Glacier:** Long-term storage (weeks to retrieve)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I know when a document should be archived vs. disposed?

**A:** Check the retention schedule for your document type. If the retention period has expired and no legal hold applies, dispose securely. If retention has expired but the document has historical or audit value, archive it.

### Q: What happens during a legal hold?

**A:** All disposal and deletion activities stop for affected documents. They remain accessible but are moved to secure hold storage. Normal processes resume only after legal approval.

### Q: Can retention periods be extended?

**A:** Yes, with proper justification. Submit a retention extension request to Compliance Team. Extensions require legal review for regulatory content.

### Q: How are AI/ML artifacts handled?

**A:** Model cards and ethics reviews retained for 10 years per EU AI Act. Training data retained for 10 years if containing personal data. Model weights and algorithms may have extended retention based on business value.

### Q: What if I need to access archived documents?

**A:** Submit an archive retrieval request through the document management system. Retrieval time depends on storage tier (immediate to weeks). All retrievals are logged for audit purposes.
