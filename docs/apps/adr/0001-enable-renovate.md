# 1. Enable Renovate Bot for Dependency Management

> NOTE: For project-level context and strategy, see `docs/00-foundation/project-context.md`.

Date: [Current Date]

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project has a Renovate configuration (`.github/renovate.json`) set up for automated dependency updates, but it is currently disabled pending delivery. Enabling Renovate will ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date, security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, and maintenance overhead is reduced.

## Decision

Enable the Renovate GitHub App on the repository to automate dependency updates according to the configured rules.

## Consequences

- Positive: Automated PRs for dependency updates, grouped by type, with automerge for minor patches.
- Negative: Potential for breaking changes in major updates; requires monitoring of PRs.
- Risk: Low, as automerge is only for safe updates.

## Implementation

1. Install Renovate GitHub App on the repository.
2. Monitor initial PRs for any issues.
3. Adjust configuration if needed based on feedback.

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual dependency updates: Time-consuming and error-prone.
- Dependabot: Less flexible than Renovate for monorepos.
