# EU AI Act Compliance Assessment

> NOTE: For project-level context and strategy, see `docs/00-foundation/project-context.md`.

## Overview

This document outlines Political Sphere's compliance with the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689). The AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level and imposes requirements accordingly. Use this assessment as a living record: update when systems change.

## AI Systems Inventory

### 1. Performance Monitor

- **System**: AI operation monitoring and metrics collection
- **Risk Classification**: Minimal risk
- **Justification**: Internal monitoring only, no external automated decision-making
- **Requirements Met**:
  - Basic documentation
  - Data minimisation

### 2. Governance Engine

- **System**: AI usage control, ethics enforcement, content moderation
- **Risk Classification**: High risk
- **Justification**: Content moderation affects users and may have legal/rights impact
- **Requirements Met / In Progress**:
  - Data governance framework (in progress)
  - Bias detection algorithms (in development)
  - Human oversight mechanisms (design stage)
  - Transparency measures (documentation required)

### 3. GitHub Copilot Integration

- **System**: AI-powered code completion and generation tool
- **Risk Classification**: Minimal risk
- **Justification**: Developer assistance, not deployed in user-facing decision-making
- **Requirements Met**:
  - Transparency: Documented in developer guidelines
  - Data Governance: No organizational training data is exposed

### 4. Local AI Helpers (Ollama-based)

- **System**: Local LLMs used for commit messages, PR reviews and developer assistance
- **Risk Classification**: Minimal risk
- **Justification**: Local processing; no external data sharing by default
- **Requirements Met**:
  - Data protection: local-only by policy
  - Transparency: usage documented

### 5. Automated Testing and CI/CD Tools

- **System**: AI-assisted test generation and flaky-test detection
- **Risk Classification**: Minimal risk

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk AI Systems

- **Governance Engine** — Classified as high-risk due to moderation capabilities.
- **Status**: Compliance measures in progress.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Conformity assessment (third-party if required)
  - CE marking (where applicable)
  - Data governance (Article 10)
  - Transparency (Article 13)
  - Human oversight (Article 14)
  - Accuracy, robustness & cybersecurity controls (Article 15)

### Limited- and Minimal-Risk Systems

- **Limited risk**: Systems that require transparency measures and user information.
- **Minimal risk**: Internal tooling and developer assistants; basic documentation and good practices suffice.

## Data Governance

### Training & Operational Data

- Document sources, licences, retention, and minimisation steps for any training or operational datasets.
- Prefer synthetic or privacy-preserving approaches where feasible.

### Data Subject Rights

- Standard GDPR obligations apply. For player-facing AI that affects individual rights, ensure DSR (Data Subject Request) workflows are available (export, deletion, rectification).

## Conformity Assessment

### Self-Assessment

- **Completed**: 28 October 2025 (example entry — update as needed)
- **Responsible**: CTO / Compliance Officer
- **Next Review**: Annually or upon material change to AI systems

### Technical Documentation

- Maintain technical documentation and evidence for each AI system (design, training data lineage, test reports, fairness audits).

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Continuous Compliance

- Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD where feasible (linting, configuration checks, evidence presence).
- Keep audit logs for AI-system changes and approvals.

### Incident Reporting

- Follow internal incident procedure and report to the relevant authority per AI Act timelines where required.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation (Current)

- ✅ Compliance assessment completed for initial systems
- ✅ AI systems inventory created

### Phase 2: Technical Controls

- [ ] Add AI Act compliance checks to CI/CD
- [ ] Implement AI system change approval process
- [ ] Create compliance monitoring dashboard

### Phase 3: Ongoing Compliance

- [ ] Annual compliance reviews
- [ ] Staff training on AI Act requirements
