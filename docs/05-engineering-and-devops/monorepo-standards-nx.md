## 🎯 Objectives

- Maximize code reuse and maintainability across apps and libs.
- Enable efficient CI/CD with affected-based builds and caching.
- Enforce architectural boundaries and dependency rules.
- Support scalable development in a zero-budget environment.

## 🧱 Nx Workspace Structure

```
apps/
├── api/          # Backend API (Fastify + GraphQL)
├── frontend/     # Main React app
├── worker/       # Background job processor
├── host/         # Module federation host
├── remote/       # Module federation remote
├── infrastructure/ # IaC and deployment
└── dev/          # Development tools

libs/
├── shared/       # Common utilities, types, constants
├── ui/           # Reusable React components
├── infrastructure/ # Infra modules (e.g., DB, auth)
└── platform/     # Platform-specific configs

tools/
├── executors/    # Custom Nx executors
├── generators/   # Code generators
└── scripts/      # Build and utility scripts
```

## 📋 Project Configuration

### nx.json

- **Named Inputs:** Define `production` and `test` inputs for selective builds.
- **Target Defaults:** Configure caching, parallelization, and affected strategies.
- **Release:** Use Nx release for versioning and publishing.

### project.json (per project)

- **Targets:** Define build, test, lint, e2e targets with appropriate configurations.
- **Dependencies:** Use implicitDeps for shared libs; explicit for cross-boundary deps.
- **Tags:** Apply tags like `scope:shared`, `type:app` for access control.

## 🔗 Dependency Rules

| From                | To                  | Allowed | Rationale        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| apps/\*             | libs/shared         | ✅      | Core utilities   |
| apps/\*             | libs/ui             | ✅      | UI components    |
| apps/\*             | libs/infrastructure | ✅      | Infra services   |
| apps/\*             | libs/platform       | ✅      | Platform configs |
| libs/shared         | libs/\*             | ❌      | No upward deps   |
| libs/ui             | libs/shared         | ✅      | Depends on utils |
| libs/infrastructure | libs/shared         | ✅      | Depends on utils |
| libs/platform       | libs/\*             | ❌      | Config only      |

**Enforcement:** Use Nx dep-graph and lint rules to prevent violations.

## 🛠️ Development Commands

| Command                           | Purpose                      | Example                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `nx build <project>`              | Build specific project       | `nx build api`                    |
| `nx test <project>`               | Run tests for project        | `nx test shared`                  |
| `nx lint <project>`               | Lint project                 | `nx lint frontend`                |
| `nx graph`                        | Visualize dependencies       | `nx graph`                        |
| `nx affected --target=build`      | Build only affected projects | `nx affected --target=build`      |
| `nx run-many --target=test --all` | Test all projects            | `nx run-many --target=test --all` |

## 📦 Library Sharing

- **Publishable Libs:** Use `@political-sphere/shared` for npm publishing if needed.
- **Internal Libs:** Keep private; import via relative paths or Nx paths.
- **Versioning:** Semantic versioning; use Nx release for automated tagging.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

- **Affected Builds:** Use `nx affected` to build/test only changed projects.
- **Caching:** Enable Nx Cloud (free tier) for remote caching.
- **Parallelization:** Run targets in parallel where possible.
- **Artifacts:** Store build outputs for deployment.

---

## 📎 Best Practices

- **Project Naming:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `political-core`).
- **Code Generators:** Create templates for new apps/libs to ensure consistency.
- **Migrations:** Use Nx migrations for workspace updates.
- **Documentation:** Maintain READMEs in each project root.
