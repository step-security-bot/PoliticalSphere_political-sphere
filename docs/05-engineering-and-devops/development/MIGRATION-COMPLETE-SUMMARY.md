**Date:** 2025-11-07  
**Migration Branch:** `refactor/apps-structure-migration`  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete, ✅ Phase 2 Complete, ✅ Phase 3 Verified, ✅ Phase 4 Structural Verification Complete

---

> NOTE: For project-level context and strategy, see `docs/00-foundation/project-context.md`.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1: App Renames (SUCCESS)

The following apps were successfully renamed using `git mv` to preserve history:

| Old Name   | New Name              | Status | Build Status |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `frontend` | `web`                 | ✅     | ✅ Passing   |
| `host`     | `shell`               | ✅     | ✅ Passing   |
| `remote`   | `feature-auth-remote` | ✅     | ✅ Passing   |

**Actions Taken:**

- Used `git mv` to rename directories (preserves git history)
- Updated `project.json` files in each app
- Updated `nx.json` workspace configuration
- Updated `tools/scripts/performance-baseline.json` references
- Cleared Nx cache and regenerated project graph

**Verification:**

```bash
npx nx show projects
# Shows: web, shell, feature-auth-remote ✅

npx nx run-many -t build --projects=web,shell,feature-auth-remote
# All builds successful ✅
```

### Configuration Updates

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/project.json` - Updated project name from "frontend" to "web"
- `apps/shell/project.json` - Updated project name from "host" to "shell"
- `apps/feature-auth-remote/project.json` - Updated project name from "remote" to "feature-auth-remote"
- `nx.json` - Updated defaultProject and workspace references
- `tools/scripts/performance-baseline.json` - Changed "frontend" metrics to "web"

**Git Commits:**

- `cde5966` - refactor(apps): rename apps to intended structure
- `860c4bb` - chore: update performance baselines to reference renamed apps

## ✅ Phase 2: New Apps Generation (SUCCESS)

All missing apps were manually scaffolded (using project.json + placeholder targets) due to generator limitations. Each is marked PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION with clear status headers in source files.

| App                        | Purpose                            | Status                 | Placeholder Target                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `e2e`                      | End-to-end test harness            | PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION | `test:e2e` (echo placeholder)        |
| `load-test`                | Performance/load testing           | PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION | `test:load` (echo placeholder)       |
| `feature-dashboard-remote` | Module Federation dashboard remote | PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION | `build`, `serve` (echo placeholders) |

**Existing (previously present):** `data`, `infrastructure`, `game-server` (no change required)

**Verification:**

```bash
npx nx show projects | grep -E '(e2e|load-test|feature-dashboard-remote)'
npx nx run e2e:test:e2e
npx nx run load-test:test:load
npx nx run feature-dashboard-remote:build
```

All placeholder commands executed successfully.

## ✅ Phase 3: Verification (SUCCESS)

**Build System:**

- ✅ Nx project graph regenerated successfully
- ✅ All renamed apps build without errors
- ✅ Dependency graph generated (see `migration-complete-graph.html`)
- ✅ No broken imports detected

**Nx Cache:**

- ✅ Cache cleared with `npx nx reset`
- ✅ Projects recognized with new names

**Import Validation:**

- ✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript imports reference old app names
- ✅ No GitHub workflows reference old paths
- ✅ Performance baselines updated

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Structural Verification and Cleanup (SUCCESS)

All apps now match `file-structure.md` blueprint exactly.

**Files Removed:**

- ❌ `apps/e2e/src/index.ts` - Conflicted with blueprint (E2E tests organized by target, not src/)
- ❌ `apps/load-test/src/example.k6.js` - Conflicted with blueprint (scenarios in scenarios/)
- ❌ `apps/feature-dashboard-remote/src/index.js` - Placeholder conflicted with intended structure

**Proper Implementations Added:**

**E2E Tests (7 spec files):**

- ✅ `apps/e2e/web/home.spec.ts` - Home page E2E tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/web/login.spec.ts` - Authentication flow tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/web/gameplay.spec.ts` - Game mechanics tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/web/admin.spec.ts` - Admin interface tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/api/health.spec.ts` - API health check tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/api/auth.spec.ts` - API authentication tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/api/game-actions.spec.ts` - Game action API tests
- ✅ `apps/e2e/fixtures/README.md` - Test fixtures documentation

**Load Test Scenarios (4 scenario files):**

- ✅ `apps/load-test/scenarios/api-load.js` - API load testing
- ✅ `apps/load-test/scenarios/game-simulation.js` - Game server load simulation
- ✅ `apps/load-test/scenarios/websocket-stress.js` - WebSocket stress tests
- ✅ `apps/load-test/scenarios/concurrent-users.js` - Concurrent user simulation

**Subdirectory Structures Added:**

Per blueprint specifications, added proper subdirectories to:

- ✅ `apps/api/` - src/modules, src/middleware, src/utils, openapi/, prisma/, tests/
- ✅ `apps/web/` - src/pages, src/hooks, src/utils, src/styles, src/assets, tests/
- ✅ `apps/game-server/` - src/engine, src/simulation, src/websocket, tests/
- ✅ `apps/worker/` - src/jobs, src/queues
- ✅ `apps/shell/` - src/remotes
- ✅ `apps/feature-auth-remote/` - src/components
- ✅ `apps/data/` - src/pipelines, src/transformers, src/connectors, src/jobs, config/, tests/
- ✅ `apps/infrastructure/` - src/provisioning, src/deployment, src/monitoring, src/cli, src/utils, tests/
- ✅ `apps/dev/` - src/experiments, src/tools, src/sandbox with proper subdirs

**Documentation Added (30+ README.md files):**

Added README.md files to all major subdirectories for discoverability:

- API modules, middleware, utils, openapi, prisma
- Web pages, hooks, utils, styles, assets
- Game server engine, simulation, websocket
- Worker jobs, queues
- Shell remotes
- Feature-auth-remote components
- Data pipelines, transformers, connectors, jobs
- Infrastructure provisioning, deployment, monitoring, CLI, utils
- Dev experiments, tools, sandbox
- E2E fixtures
- All test directories

**Git Commit:**

- `0b059c4` - chore(apps): complete structural verification and cleanup

   npm test
   # Or target specific projects with tests configured
   npx nx run-many -t test --all
   ```

### Merge to Main (When Ready)

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# 2. Switch to main

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

- **Git mv approach:** Preserving history with `git mv` worked perfectly
- **Backup strategy:** Multiple backup tags provided safety net
- **Incremental commits:** Easier to track what changed at each step
- **Nx cache reset:** Cleared stale project graph issues immediately

### Challenges Encountered

- **Nx generator limitations:** `@nx/workspace:move` not available, adapted to manual approach
- **Project graph caching:** Required `nx reset` to recognize renamed apps
- **Phase 2 generation:** Couldn't auto-generate new apps during migration, will handle post-merge

### Recommendations for Future Migrations

1. Always use `git mv` for renames to preserve history
2. Clear Nx cache (`npx nx reset`) immediately after filesystem changes
3. Generate new apps as separate step after structural changes merge
4. Test builds incrementally after each phase
5. Keep migration branch separate from main until fully verified

## 🎯 Alignment with Governance

This migration aligns with:

- **ORG-01:** File placement - Apps now follow intended naming conventions
- **ORG-03:** Naming standards - `kebab-case` consistently applied
- **QUAL-06:** Documentation - Migration fully documented
- **STRAT-02:** ADR governance - Migration plan documented in `/docs`

**Constitutional Check:** N/A - Structural refactor does not affect voting, speech, moderation, or power distribution.
