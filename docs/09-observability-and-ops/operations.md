# Operational Excellence

**Version:** 2.0.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-05

## Observability by Design

Build monitoring into every service:

**Define SLOs/SLIs:** **Availability** (% uptime target: 99.9%). **Latency** (p50, p95, p99 response times). **Error Rate** (% failed requests). **Saturation** (resource utilization). **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:** **Metrics** (counters, gauges, histograms). **Logs** (structured JSON format). **Traces** (distributed tracing with context propagation). **Error Budgets:** Define budget per service. Track consumption. Gate releases when exhausted.

## Incident Management

Prepare for failures: **Runbooks** (step-by-step issue resolution). **Playbooks** (incident response procedures). **Escalation paths** (clear ownership chains). **Postmortems** (blameless, actionable). **Action items** (track and complete learnings).

## Disaster Recovery

Plan for worst-case scenarios: **Backups** (automated daily, 30-day retention). **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective ≤ 1 hour data loss). **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective ≤ 4 hours downtime). **Testing** (quarterly recovery drills). **Documentation** (detailed recovery procedures).

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Everything in version control: Terraform for cloud resources. Kubernetes manifests for deployments. Dockerfiles for container images. Configuration as code. Immutable infrastructure pattern. **Progressive Delivery:** Canary deployments (test with small traffic %). Blue-green deployments (zero downtime). Feature flags for gradual rollout. Fast, safe rollback capability.

## Capacity & Resilience

Scale intelligently: **Capacity planning** (traffic projections, growth estimates). **Cost optimization** (right-sizing, auto-scaling policies). **High availability** (multi-zone deployment). **Future scaling** (multi-region for critical services). **Regular reviews** (monthly cost and capacity audits).
