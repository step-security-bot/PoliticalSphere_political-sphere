## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Complete First)

### 1. Database Setup (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKING ALL PROGRESS
**Impact**: Nothing persists, game is non-functional

- [ ] **Install PostgreSQL** (or use Docker)
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install postgresql@16
  brew services start postgresql@16
  
  # Or use Docker
  docker run --name political-sphere-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
  ```

- [ ] **Create Database**
  ```bash
  createdb political_sphere_dev
  ```

- [ ] **Update .env with PostgreSQL URL**
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/political_sphere_dev"
  ```

- [ ] **Run Prisma Migrations**
  ```bash
  cd apps/api
  npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
  npx prisma generate
  ```

### High Priority
5. ⚠️ **Missing tests** - 60+ tests needed for new code
6. ⚠️ **No error handling** - App crashes on errors
7. ⚠️ **No loading states** - Poor UX
8. ⚠️ **No mobile optimization** - Doesn't work on phones

### Medium Priority
9. 🟡 **No WebSocket** - No real-time features

- ✅ Clear vision and roadmap

### What Needs Attention
- ⚠️ Database setup is critical blocker
- ⚠️ Frontend-backend integration gap
- ⚠️ Testing coverage insufficient
- ⚠️ Production deployment not ready
- ⚠️ Real-time features missing

### Lessons Learned
1. **Start with database first** - Should have set up PostgreSQL earlier
