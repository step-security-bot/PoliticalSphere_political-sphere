## Executive Summary

This document identifies threats to our CI/CD pipeline and defines mitigations to protect our democratic governance platform. Given our mission-critical role in supporting democratic processes, our CI/CD security posture must meet the highest standards.

**Threat Level**: HIGH - CI/CD compromise can lead to supply chain attacks affecting production systems.

- Deployment pipelines
- Third-party actions and dependencies

**Out of Scope**:

- Application-level threats (covered in separate threat model)
